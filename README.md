# Perlin-Voronoi-Density

All of these concepts—Perlin noise, density for mountain heights, 
and Voronoi diagrams—can be utilized in the process of procedural generation. Procedural generation involves using algorithms and mathematical functions to create content or environments dynamically, rather than manually designing them. By incorporating Perlin noise to generate density and mountain heights, and employing Voronoi diagrams to divide maps into distinct 
districts, procedural generation techniques can produce diverse and realistic landscapes, cities, or other complex environments

# Perlin Noise
Perlin noise is a type of random signal that exhibits natural-looking patterns. 


# Voronoi Diagram
Voronoi diagrams are geometric structures that partition a space into distinct regions based on a set of points or seeds.

# Density
In the context of generating mountains, the concept of "density" refers to the distribution of height values across the terrain. 
Perlin noise is often utilized to determine the density of different regions on the map.
